      "output": "The distance between Earth and Mars is constantly changing because both planets are orbiting the Sun at different speeds and distances.  There's no single answer.\n\nTo give you a sense of scale:\n\n* Closest approach: At their closest, Earth and Mars can be approximately 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles) apart.\n* Farthest distance: At their farthest, they can be as far as 401 million kilometers (249 million miles) apart.\n\nTherefore, a precise answer requires knowing the specific date for which you need the distance."
